Hello, i'am trying to implement cylinder rotation in miniRT and i've a problem,
so far i've produced this code :
To get the angle of rotation according to each axis i do this
t_vector3   rotation_cy(t_cylinder cy)
{
    t_vector3   tmp;
    t_vector3   rot;

    tmp = cy.n;
    tmp.x = 0;
    rot.x = acos(ft_dot(vector3(0, 1, 0), ft_normalize(tmp)));
    tmp = cy.n;
    tmp.z = 0;
    rot.z = acos(ft_dot(vector3(0, 1, 0), ft_normalize(tmp)));
    rot.y = 0;
    return (rot);
}

and to apply that angle to the ray i do this

ray.p1 = rotate_vector(ray.p1, ft_multi(rot, -1));
ray.p2 = rotate_vector(ray.p2, ft_multi(rot, -1));

But my cylinder doesn't show up unless the orientation vector is (0,1,0).
