# What is MiniRT

A mini RayTracer made using c and a 42 mini graphics library _MiniLibX_.

# How to install
Only for testing, if you are doing this project for school too, or simply intrested in creating a RayTracer, i encourage you to write you own code instead of copying it.

if you haven't already, you have to install MinilibX (MLX) in order to use this project
